    <p>Derrick and Katherine met in college at the University of Texas in 2006, where they were both students of the Mechanical Engineering Program, but didn't reconnect until Fall of 2013.
    Derrick was moving back to Houston from Oklahoma City to start his own business.
    Katherine was working as an engineer at Dow Chemical in Freeport, Texas.
    They reconnected on Facebook one night, and ended up going out to lunch that weekend.
    Lunch turned into an all day event, and when they closed the bars at 2am, Derrick asked Katherine if he could take her on a &ldquo;real date&rdquo; when he moved back to Houston.
