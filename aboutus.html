            <h2>About Derrick</h2>
            <p>Derrick Turk was born in The Woodlands, Texas before it was cool.
            He grew up in the area north of Houston before leaving to attend the
            University of Texas at Austin, where he studied mechanical
            engineering for lack of a better idea.
            <p>Since then, he has worked as a petroleum engineer across East
            Texas and in Oklahoma.
            After two record-setting F5 tornadoes in a span of three weeks,
            Derrick decided to move back to Houston to pursue a long-held dream
            of entrepreneurship.
            <p>He currently serves as the president, principal consultant,
            and sole member of <a href="http://www.terminusdatascience.com">
            terminus data science, LLC</a>, providing consulting on data
            science, statistical analysis, data-driven engineering, and custom
            software development to oil and gas producers.
            You can also check out <a href="https://github.com/derrickturk/">
            his GitHub page</a>, if you're into that.
            <p>When he's not writing software or staring at numbers, he enjoys
            cooking breakfast, traveling to new places, and meeting new people.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Derrick and Katherine met in college at the University of Texas in 2006,
    where they were both students in mechanical engineering.
    They were friends in college, but neither can remember their first meeting.
    Believe me, they've tried.
    <p>After both moved away for work, they reconnected in the fall of 2013.
    Derrick was in Houston to plan his move back from Oklahoma City to start his
    own business. Katherine was working in Freeport and frequented Houston on
    the weekend.
    They reconnected on Facebook one night, and made plans to go out for lunch
    that weekend.
    Lunch turned into an all day event, and when the bars turned on their bright
    fluorescent lights at 2 in the morning, Derrick asked Katherine if he could
    take her on a &ldquo;real date&rdquo; when he moved back to Houston.
    <p>After a whirlwind romance which took to them to exciting places including
    Paris, Brussels, Cozumel, and Surfside Beach in Freeport, Derrick
    proposed to Katherine on a balcony overlooking Lady Bird Lake in Austin,
    Texas one year to the day after their first date.
    Katherine said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;!
    <p>Together, they enjoy traveling the world, relaxing with friends,
    having goofy adventures, and plotting to crush the competition when they
    finally launch their taco/waffle/pizza food truck, tentatively named
    &ldquo;Tacopalypse Now&rdquo;.
